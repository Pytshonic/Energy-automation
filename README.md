# Energy-automation
This is a program that takes the envelope information from hap v5.11 and inputs it into comcheck web

The purpose of this program is to simplify the amount of clicks needed to complete an energy calculation.
Although the program is currently a web automation I would like it to eventually be a stand alone product. Since commcheck web does not have an api this is the next
best thing. 
Also this is a demo for the commcheck API
and this program will be used for me to practice my coding and enhance my learning.

    Scraper.py
    
This python script pulls data from HAP V5.11 by scraping data from the PDF files that can be created in hap by printing an input report, and a window report.
